# Postman backend

This is the backend for the [Postman iOS application](https://github.com/apals/postman-ios) made for the [Postnord hackathon](http://postnord-hackathon.com/) on 16-17 february 2017.

It is a JSON API that allows users to log in and get their own personal data (`/me`), see what requests have been made for packages to be picked up (`/request/pending`), list all requests (`/requests`) and create request. It also shows all service points entered in the system, scraped from Postnord's own API.
